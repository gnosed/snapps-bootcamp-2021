# SnarkyJS Blind Auction

First-price sealed-bid auction (aka blind auction) with SnarkyJS.


```sh
npm i
npx tsc
node dist/node dist/blind-auction-snapp.js
```

## Improvements
This is still a command-only PoC.

A cool thing to do would be to connect to a simple frontend where the user can submit bids with different accounts.
